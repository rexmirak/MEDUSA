  #   TTPquery = [{"kill chain phases": "Reconnaissance, Initial Access", "description": "Adversaries may gather information about the victim's organization that can be used during targeting.\n\nThe first DNS query ( company-name.com IN A) suggests an initial reconnaissance phase where adversaries attempt to gather initial domain name (IDN). This could potentially serve as a domain of interest, which is later followed by additional DNS queries such as those for subdomains (careers.company-name.com IN A).\n\nIn the subsequent HTTP requests, we see the use of different domains for LinkedIn and Facebook in order to attempt to gain access to the company's credentials. The Google search query with a specific keyword may be an effort to identify if the company has been targeted before or if there are publicly available details about them.\n\nThe DNS query (mail.company-name.com IN MX) indicates that the adversary is trying to find out what email addresses have administrative roles within the organization, and this can provide information on potential targets for phishing attacks. This could also help adversaries with gaining initial access through email exploits.\n\nGiven these different types of DNS queries and HTTP requests, it appears that an adversary was attempting to gather a wide range of information about company name, specific personnel, email addresses, and online platforms that may have connections to the company. This gathered information could be used in later phases to attempt to gain initial access through targeted phishing or spear phishing attacks.\n\nThis is consistent with the pattern of activity seen in other publicized cases where adversaries use various techniques for gathering intel on potential targets before attempting to establish a foothold in their systems."}]

  #  "description": "Adversaries may send spearphishing messages with a malicious link to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting. Spearphishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Spearphishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex: [Establish Accounts](T1585) or [Compromise Accounts](T1586)) and/or sending multiple, seemingly urgent messages.\n\nAll forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, the malicious emails contain links generally accompanied by social engineering text to coax the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser.(Citation: TrendMictro Phishing)(Citation: PCMag FakeLogin) The given website may closely resemble a legitimate site in appearance and have a URL containing elements from the real site. From the fake website, information is gathered in web forms and sent to the attacker. Adversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](T1593) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](T1594)) to craft persuasive and believable lures."

Adversaries can also use internationalized domain names (IDNs) to create visually similar lookalike domains for use in operations.(Citation: CISA IDN ST05-016)\n\nDomain registrars each maintain a publicly viewable database that displays contact information for every registered domain. Private WHOIS services display alternative information, such as their own company data, rather than the owner of the domain. Adversaries may use such private WHOIS services to obscure information about who owns a purchased domain. Adversaries may further interrupt efforts to track their infrastructure by using varied registration information and purchasing domains with different domain registrars.(Citation: Mandiant APT1)"

Prior to a phish for information (as in [Spearphishing Link](T1598.003)) or a phish to gain initial access to a system (as in [Spearphishing Link](T1566.002)), an adversary must set up the resources for a link target for the spearphishing link. \n\nTypically, the resources for a link target will be an HTML page that may include some client-side script such as [JavaScript](T1059.007) to decide what content to serve to the user. Adversaries may clone legitimate sites to serve as the link target, this can include cloning of login pages of legitimate web services or organization login pages in an effort to harvest credentials during [Spearphishing Link](T1598.003).(Citation: Malwarebytes Silent Librarian October 2020)(Citation: Proofpoint TA407 September 2019) Adversaries may also [Upload Malware](T1608.001) and have the link target point to malware for download/execution by the user.\n\nAdversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains (ex: homoglyphs, typosquatting, different top-level domain, etc.) during acquisition of infrastructure ([Domains](T1583.001)) to help facilitate [Malicious Link](T1204.001).
